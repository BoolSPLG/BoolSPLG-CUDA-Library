About BoolSPLG (Boolean functions and S-box Parallel Library for GPU)

Current release: v0.3

What is BoolSPLG?

BoolSPLG (Boolean functions and S-box Parallel Library for GPU) provides, reusable software components for every layer of the CUDA programming model. 
BoolSPLG is a library consisting procedures for analysis and compute cryptographic properties of Boolean and Vector Boolean function (S-box).

How do I get started using BoolSPLG?

BoolSPLG is implemented as a C++ header library. There is no need to “build” BoolSPLG separately. To use BoolSPLG primitives in your code, simply:

1. "Download and unzip the latest BoolSPLG distribution from the Downloads section and extract the contents of the zip file to a directory." 
Clone a repository from GitHub to your local computer. Cloning the BoolSPLG-v0.3 library resource folder:
$cd "directory"
$ git clone
https://github.com/BoolSPLG/BoolSPLG-v0.3-CUDA-Library
...
$
You need to install (copy) only “BoolSPLG” directory from the main BoolSPLG-vx.x directory. We suggest installing BoolSPLG to the CUDA include directory,
which is usually:
	- /usr/include/ on a Linux (Ubuntu);
	- C:\CUDA\include\ on a Windows system. 
	
Example: C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.4\include\;

If you are unable to install BoolSPLG to the CUDA include directory, then you can place BoolSPLG somewhere in your home directory, 
for example: /home/nathan/libraries/.

2. #include the "umbrella" <BoolSPLG/BoolSPLG_v03.cuh> header file in your CUDA C++ sources;

3. Compile your program with NVIDIA's nvcc CUDA compiler, specifying a -I<path-to- BoolSPLG> include-path flag to reference the 
location of the BoolSPLG header library.

Examples

BoolSPLG distribution directory contain “examples” directory with examples (Boolean and S-box) programs. For the examples to work there is need to 
include (add) the additional header files from the directory “help and additional header files”. This additional header files contain CPU Boolean and 
S-box function used for comparison and checking the obtained results from GPU functions.
